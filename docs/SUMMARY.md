# Project Summary

## What We've Accomplished

1. **Analysis of the Codex TypeScript Project**
   - Reviewed the architecture and components
   - Understood the CLI structure and workflow
   - Analyzed file operations and security model
   - Documented the UI components and user interactions

2. **Architecture Documentation**
   - Created `docs/architecture.md` explaining the TypeScript architecture
   - Documented the planned Go implementation architecture
   - Defined package structure and component responsibilities
   - Outlined differences and considerations for the Go implementation

3. **Go Project Setup**
   - Initialized the Go module with dependencies
   - Created directory structure following Go best practices
   - Set up configuration files (.gitignore, Makefile)
   - Added build and run scripts

4. **Core Components Implementation**
   - Created the CLI entry point using Cobra
   - Implemented configuration loading and validation
   - Set up the agent interface for AI providers
   - Implemented the OpenAI agent for API interactions
   - Created sandbox for secure command execution
   - Implemented file operations for reading and writing files
   - Developed terminal UI using Bubble Tea

5. **Testing & Documentation**
   - Added tests for the config package
   - Created test documentation explaining how to run tests
   - Added README with usage instructions
   - Created a Makefile for common tasks

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Agent Implementation**
   - Implement conversation history management
   - Add support for image inputs
   - Improve error handling and recovery

2. **Enhance Sandbox Security**
   - Implement platform-specific sandbox enforcement
   - Add network isolation for command execution
   - Validate file paths for security

3. **UI Enhancements**
   - Implement command approval UI
   - Add file diff viewing and approval
   - Create help and settings screens

4. **Additional Providers**
   - Add support for Anthropic models
   - Create a provider factory for easy switching
   - Implement custom prompt formats for each provider

5. **Testing**
   - Add more unit tests for all packages
   - Create integration tests with mocked AI responses
   - Add benchmark tests for performance analysis

6. **Documentation**
   - Add godoc comments to all exported functions
   - Create usage examples for library consumers
   - Add contribution guidelines

## Conclusion

We've successfully laid the foundation for a Go port of the Codex project. The core architecture and components are in place, providing a solid base for further development. The project follows Go best practices and is structured to be maintainable and extensible.

The implementation maintains the key features of the original TypeScript version while leveraging Go's strengths in concurrency, performance, and cross-platform compatibility.
